  Identify the distinct STORIES in this livestream transcript.

  **Total video duration: {duration}**

  ## What is a "story"?

  A story is a self-contained segment about ONE primary subject (a person, event, or topic).
  Everything discussed in response to that subject is part of the same story.
  A NEW story begins only when the host moves to a completely UNRELATED subject.

  ## Your task

  1. Read through the transcript
  2. Find where the host switches to a completely different topic
  3. For each story, copy the EXACT words where it begins
  4. Return stories in chronological order

  ## Skip intro chatter

  The first few lines are usually technical setup - find where actual content begins.

  ## Output

  For each story (in chronological order):
  - start_phrase: Copy EXACTLY 6-10 consecutive words from where this story begins
  - title: The primary subject name
  - description: 2-4 sentence summary

  CRITICAL: start_phrase must be copied EXACTLY from the transcript - do not paraphrase!

  Return JSON only:
  {"sections": [{"start_phrase": "...", "title": "...", "description": "..."}]}
