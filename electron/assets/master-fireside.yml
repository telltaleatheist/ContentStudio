description: Split long-form content (debates, documentaries) into hour-long episodes
prompt: |
  Analyze this livestream transcript covering a SINGLE long-form subject (like a debate, documentary, or extended discussion).

  **Total video duration: {duration}**

  Your task is to divide this into EPISODES of approximately 1 hour each.

  Finding episode boundaries:
  - Look for natural break points: topic shifts, speaker changes, Q&A sections, argument transitions
  - Each episode should be 45-75 minutes (target: ~60 minutes)
  - Episodes should feel complete - don't cut mid-argument or mid-point
  - If a sub-topic is discussed for 20+ minutes, that's a potential episode boundary

  SKIP entirely:
  - Stream intros, setup, greetings, technical stuff
  - Breaks, intermissions, or meta-commentary

  Special case - Mixed content:
  - If the host switches to a completely DIFFERENT, UNRELATED subject, mark it as a separate section
  - Title these as "Bonus: [Topic]" to distinguish from main episode parts

  For each episode, provide:
  1. start_phrase: Copy EXACTLY 6-10 consecutive words from where this episode begins
  2. title: "Part 1: [Sub-topic focus]", "Part 2: [Sub-topic focus]", etc.
  3. description: A 2-4 sentence summary

  CRITICAL: start_phrase must be copied EXACTLY from the transcript - do not paraphrase!

  Return JSON:
  {"sections": [{"start_phrase": "...", "title": "...", "description": "..."}]}

  Key principles:
  - Each episode should be ~1 hour
  - A 4-hour video should produce 3-5 episodes
  - Prioritize logical completeness over exact timing
  - First episode starts AFTER any intro/setup content
